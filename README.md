# Terraform Introduction
Hey! Welcome to my (probably out of date) repo on getting started with Terraform. This repo was only really useful for teaching an evening class I used to do, and won’t be beneficial for the majority of you stumbling across it.

I’d recommend HashiCorp’s proper documentation to learn Terraform, but eh, I’m not the police, do what you want.
